Hello everyone! Welcome to my new blog!

Today I wanted to talk about a project I've been working on, and detail some of the things I found and stuff I tried. I think it'll be a good post mortem for myself to study later when I need some of these tactics again.

A couple years ago, after watching a [wonderful presentation at BlackHat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8DjTcANBx0), I bought a cheap $20 unbranded netcam. The camera came with a serial number on the bottom (C7824WIP). The camera itself isn't the worst, I mean it is a low quality Chinese camera, but the features on the device were pretty interesting. It has 2 axis panning, infrared night vision, speaker, microphone, and both wireless and wired connections, which is pretty good considering it only cost me like $20. However, a couple aspects about the device really made me worry, and as a security guy, I wanted to dig deeper.

I decided I'd try to do a full security audit on the device. I wanted to try it because I didn't really know anything about security cameras at the time, and I really wanted to try some of the skills I've picked up over the years. Black box testing can be really fun, and I love trying something I have little knowledge of just to see if I can succeed.
